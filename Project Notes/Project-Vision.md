Project Title: Interactive Elevator Portfolio

Overview
Create a unique and interactive portfolio website that resembles an elevator experience with a concierge. The site features a black background with yellow ASCII-style graphics of an elevator and a concierge who greets visitors with:

"Which floor would you like today, sir?"

Each "floor" represents a different project, and users can navigate between them using the up or down arrows, giving the site a video game-like aesthetic.
