# my-showcase-space
Hi, I'm Cameron Rutherford, and welcome to my space where I showcase my skills as both a programmer and designer, blending the artistic with the practical. Here you'll find a collection of projects I'm proud to call finished. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
